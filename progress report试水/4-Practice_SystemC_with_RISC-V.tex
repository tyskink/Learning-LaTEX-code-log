\chapter{Practice: SystemC with RISC-V}
\par The purpose of this practice is make myself to be familiar with SystemC and RISC-V architecture. To understand all the progress from IC design to simulation.
\par During this period, a counter, a register, and a program memory have been written down. And for now, I am trying to generate the execution code using RISC-V tools in Ubuntu. So, the simulation of PM still not available.
\section{Generate the execution code and disassemble code}

\section{The Simulation results}
\subsection{Counter}
\par The counter has 4 control signals: Wait, increasing 1, directly jump and related jump. Figure 4 is the simulation result.
